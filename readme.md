## Overview

**Project Title**: Homemade - Body Control Module

**Project Description**: BCM's control things like, doors, lights, windows, and pretty much anything not involved in powertrain operation in a vehicle. 

**Project Goals**: To practice arduino electronics and programming in relations to the automotive world.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Follow this link:
2. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kZYFjt44iwN-door-module?sharecode=8ottevdUhlrtyHBvZgdaHbx0SFQtZkEzAuaSlkZVoiU
3. Press run in the top right corner and then press all the different buttons and switches in the circuit and watch what it does! 

Instructions for using the software:

1. The page that will pull up from the link will be the general page of the circuit.
2. Press run and it should allow you to press the buttons and flip switches to see their process.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* The libraries should be integrated in the program already
* If you want to see the code, there should be a small "code" button next to the "run" button.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Integrate it in a vehicle
* [ ] Control more internal assemblies
* [ ] Make it IRL with my arduino board
